# Machine Learning fundamentals

## What is Machine Learning?

One sentence: Machine learning is teaching a machine to learn from data.

Machine learning is creating models that learn from data. This means programmers aren't needed to explicity do tasks, instead large amounts of data is fed into the machine and the machine uses algorithmns to identify patterns within the data. Using the patterns the machine creates a model that is used to make predictions or carry out tasks without being explicity told to do those tasks.

Machine learning model: A statistical representation of real-world process based on data

## How do you make the machine learn? The machine learning workflow:
1. Data collection
2. Data preparation
3. Train the model
4. Evaluate the model
5. Deploy machine's model

## Types of Machine learning
Depending on the data you have to teach the machine differently. 
1. Supervised learning: labelled data
2. Unsupervised learning: unlabelled data
3. Reinforcement learning

# Supervised learning
This is where the data you have has an input and an output. The machine then thinks of how to go from input to output using the data you provided. This means that when you give it unknown inputs it can create an output. 

Supervised learning has two major subcategories - classificiation and regression. Classification has discrete labels and regression has continuous labels.

- Classification tasks: 
- Regression tasks:

# Unsupervised learning
Unsupervised learning is where we have no labels, it's up to the model to tell us something interesting about the data.

Unsupervised learning has two major subcategories - clustering and dimensionality reduction. 
- Clustering algorithmns: identify groups of data
- Dimensionality reduction algorithmns: tries to make the data as simple as possible

Concepts in OOP

1. Encapsulation:
  putting funcs that affect a data in one class and limiting exposure of some of it's components.

2. Inheritance:
   allows you to inherit variables and funcs from another class. Usually the child class (new class) needs to initialise both it's own class and the parent class. 
  - Method overriding: allows the child class to override existing functions in the parent class with it's own funcs.

3. Polymorphism: 
   think of a USB port - it can be used for different things but it's still one port - one interface. This one interface principle is polymorphism. When multiple classes inherit from the base class and have the has a common function, this creates a common interface. The child classes can also modify the function to do something different, but there is still a common interface as it has the same name.  The class that runs the common interface classes doesn't need to know what specific behaviour is happening - it just calls the function name that's common in all classes.

4. Abstraction: 
  is the process of hiding the complex code and showing only what is necessary.

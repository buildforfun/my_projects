# API projects

[Based on Python Crash Course book]

What is an API?
Application Programming Interface (API) allows a program to request specific information from a website.

Web API uses specific URLs to request information (API call). The requested data is then returned in JSON or CSV format.

 API rate limits
 Most APIs are rate limited, this means there is a limit to how many requests you can make in a certain amount of time.

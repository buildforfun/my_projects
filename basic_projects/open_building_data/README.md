Calculate average EPC ratings for different streets or sub-areas.
Identify patterns or clusters of high and low energy efficiency.


Based on the EPC data, provide general recommendations for energy efficiency improvements that are relevant to your neighborhood's housing stock.
Create a platform (like a website or social media group) where neighbors can discuss the findings and share tips for improving energy efficiency.

This project would not only provide valuable insights into your neighborhood's energy efficiency but also foster community engagement and potentially lead to collective action for reducing carbon emissions.

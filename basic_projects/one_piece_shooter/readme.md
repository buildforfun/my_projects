### Game brief
This game is inspired by the Alien invason from the book Python Crash Course.

A description of the game:

In one piece shooter, luffy a character can fire his hand out at bad guys. He can move right and left using the arrow keys and shoot his hands using the spacebar. When the game begins, a fleet of bad guys moves across and down the screen. Luffy must then shoot and destroy the bad guys. If luffy can destroy all the bad guys, a new fleet of bad guys that move faster than the previous fleeet. If any bad guy gets to luffy or reaches the bottom, luffy losses a life. If Luffy loses three lives, the game ends.


Pygame
----
- pygame treats everything like rects(rectangles) as this is simle geometry
- When youâ€™re working with a rect object, you can use the x- and y-coordinates of the top, bottom, left, and right edges of the rectangle, as well as the center, to place the object
- the main code is in one piece shooter.py file, where a while loop in the  run_game function calls other functions.
- the check events functions are used to detect relevant events
- the update screen function redraws the screen on each pass

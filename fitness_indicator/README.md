1. What problem is this solving?
---------------------------------------
Many people struggle to accurately assess their own fitness levels compared to others in their age group. This is because fitness can be a complex concept, making it challenging for individuals to objectively evaluate their overall health and physical condition relative to their peers.


2. What am I building?
---------------------------------------

I'm building a tool that provides users with a single, comprehensive fitness score based on a range of general fitness metrics. This score will serve as a standardized reference point, allowing users to easily compare their fitness level to others and track their progress over time.

3. Why the market is interesting?
---------------------------------------

There is a growing focus on health, wellness and physical health. This is evidenced by the increase of health-focused Youtube channels and rapid growth of fitness wearable market.


4. Personal use
-------------------------------------------
I want to build a tool that I can use to mesure my fitness at any stage. Once a week, I am going to measure my status in all of these metrics: 
- 5K time
-
